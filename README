This module uses the Berkeley database.  This database simply contains
IP blocks as keys, and countries as values.  The data is obtained from
the ARIN, RIPE, and APNIC whois servers.  This database should be more
complete and accurate than reverse DNS lookups.

This module can be used to automatically select the geographically closest mirror,
or to target advertising by country, or to analyze your web server logs
to determine the countries of your visiters.

To find a country for an IP address, this module finds Networks
that contain the IP address, starting with a netmask of 32, going up to
3 until it finds a matching IP Block.
