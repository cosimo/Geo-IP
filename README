This module uses the Berkeley database.  This database simply contains
IP blocks as keys, and countries as values.  The data contains all
public IP addresses and should be more
complete and accurate than reverse DNS lookups.

This module can be used to automatically select the geographically closest mirror,
or to target advertising by country, or to analyze your web server logs
to determine the countries of your visiters.

To install, run:

  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make test
  make install

To find a country for an IP address, this module finds Networks
that contain the IP address, starting with a netmask of 32, going up to
3 until it finds a matching IP Block.

The database will be updated at the beginning of each month.  To update,
you have to remove Geo-IP.db, and re-run the installation process.

Ideally we would have a script to run updates.  Patches welcome!
